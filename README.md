# Nerdy Chat 🤓

Nerdy Chat is a chat application that allows users to chat with each other in real time. Users can create chat rooms and invite other users to join them! 🚀

By the moment it's a Discord clone, but in the future, it will be a chat application with its own identity, with its own features and functionalities. The objective audience is the nerdy community, like academics, developers, gamers, mathematicians, etc., and even more, the people who want to learn about these topics, so you can create a chat room with a school-like environment, made for teachers, students, and if applies, parents! 🤓
